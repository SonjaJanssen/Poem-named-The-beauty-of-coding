The beauty of coding, both simple and grand,
In R Rstudio we create, with lines of command.
Data comes alive, in vectors and frames,
With plots and graphs, we play with its games.

Functions and loops, they dance hand in hand,
Creating solutions, that we understand.
From data manipulation to analysis  so deep,
R and RStudio helps us explore, secrets to keep.

So let us write codes, like verses of rhyme,
Solving problems anew, one step at a time.
With each line we write, a beautiful story unfolds,
In the world of R RStudio, where creativity molds.

Farewell to this poem, written in code,
In R RStudio we find wonders, in every line showed.
